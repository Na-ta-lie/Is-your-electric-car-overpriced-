### Overview

This [R Shiny app](https://na-ta-lie.shinyapps.io/Electric_Vehicle_MLR_Price_Predictor/) allows you to explore and compare the features of 307 electric vehicles, and predict what the price of an electric car should be based on its features.

You can also compare the predicted price of a vehicle to the mean price for car makes with 10+ models included inthe data set.

**See how your car compares to others so you don't end up overpaying!**

### Data

This collection of data on electric vehicles came from [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatihilhan/electric-vehicle-specifications-and-prices/). The original set included 360 observations and 9 variables.

**Variables**

-   Battery: The capacity of the vehicle's battery in kilowatt-hours (kWh).
-   Car_name: The model name of the electric vehicle.
-   Car_name_link: A direct link to the corresponding page on EV Database for more in-depth information.
-   Efficiency: The energy efficiency rating of the vehicle in watt-hours per kilometer (Wh/km).
-   Fast_charge: The fast-charging capability of the vehicle in minutes for a certain charging percentage.
-   Price.DE.: The price of the electric vehicle in Germany.
-   Range: The driving range of the vehicle on a single charge in kilometers.
-   Top_speed: The maximum speed the vehicle can achieve in kilometers per hour.
-   Acceleration..0.100.: The acceleration time from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour.

### Development

This data required minimal processing. I created a Make variable by extracting the first word from the Car_name variable. I also renamed several columns to make them more intuitive for example acceleration..0.100. to Acceleration. I removed the two cars that did not have Fast Charge (the Renault Twingo Electric and the e.Go e.wave X) capability because this was an important feature in the linear regression and was impacting their price. Finally I made sure all the continuous variables were next to each other to simplify calling them. I split the dataframe into two. One with prices(307 objects) and one with missing prices (51 objects).

After cleaning the data 45 unique car makes were included in the ecars data used to create the linear model and 22 unique car makes were included in the data with missing prices. Additionally 14 makes that have 10 or more car models are highlighted throughout the project.

For the multiple linear regression, I started by making a linear model including all the continuous variables

Using that model and an empty model I did an AIC which eliminated Battery. I expected either Battery or Range to be eliminated because of their co-linearity

Price did not have a normal distribution so I did a BoxCox transformation and then redid the model after transforming the price.

Look closely at variable relationships. You can examine the co-linear relationship between Battery and Range.\
